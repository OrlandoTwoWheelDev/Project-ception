            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            
            <p>
              Maintenance is a critical aspect of HVAC systems. Generally there are two types of maintenance:
              Maintenance done by the homeowner and maintenance done by the hvac technician.
            </p>

            <p>
              My consistent recommendations for the homeowner is changing the air filter(s) every month, 
              ensuring no dust is built up on the thermostat, rinsing the outdoor coil with medium pressure water, 
              and flushing the drain line.
            </p>

            <p>
              I know, it may seem like a lot to change the air filters so frequently, but the air filter is one of 3 lungs of the indoor unit.
              The other two being the indoor unit as a whole (coil and blower motor), and then your lungs.
              That being said, the air filter protects the indoor unit from dust and debris, which also protects your lungs. 
              This will also depend on the type and quality of your air filter. Air filter quality is rated by the Minimum Efficiency 
              Reporting Value (MERV), ranging from 1 to 16, for standard residential use. They do have higher ratings, but most homeowners are accustomed 
              to this range. Now, the higher the MERV rating, the more dust and debris it will catch, but it will also restrict airflow. While, the lower the 
              MERV rating the less dust and debris it will catch, but it will allow more airflow. Later on, i will go into more details to pinpoint 
              the best MERV rating for your home as part of the technician side of the maintenance. Filter types can also vary by thickness, generally
              between 1" and 5". The 1" filters are the most common, usually placed in a slot at the air handler, or in a filter back grill
              somewhere in the home. However, filters over 1" are generally found in a filter rack that sits underneath(or on the return side) of the air handler. 
              The biggest difference with these thicker filters is that you can go longer intervals between changes, usually 3-6 months. They also have less of an 
              impact on airflow when compared to similar MERV rated 1" filters, and tend to caputure more dust and debris as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              The thermostat is the brain of the system, and if it is dirty, it will not be able to accurately read the temperature in the home. 
              This will cause the system to run longer than necessary, which can lead to higher energy bills and unnecessary wear and tear on the system.
              Most thermostats will only need to be dusted off with a dry cloth and blown out with compressed air. You can also while down the display
              if it has big screen. Most of the newer thermostats are digital, and have a lock screen feature, allowing you to clean the screen with 
              a damp cloth. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Rinsing the outdoor coil is vital to the system's performance. Since it wouldnt be feasible to filter the air that is being pulled through its fins,
              water is the best option to care for it. Simply turning the system off at the thermostat is all you need to do before rinsing it off. 
              You will want to use the "fan" setting on an adjustable nozzle, or medium pressure water if you don't have a nozzle. A pressure washer is 
              never recommended, as it can damage the fins. The rinsing process is simple, just rinsse the coil side to side, from top to bottom. 
              You will likely notice dirt and debris coming off the coil, which is a good sign. It is also advised to rinse underneath the unit, 
              this will help with drainage and keep the unit from rusting out as fast or maybe at all! The rinsing frequency will depend on the surrounding 
              environment, but generally once a month is a good rule of thumb. After rinsing, you can turn the system back on at the thermostat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Flushing the drain line can be very simple as well. There is generally a white pvc pip that runs out from the bottom of the air handler
              that brings the condensation from the unit to the outside. This is the drain line. What I have always recommended is a gallon of hot water. 
              You can pour it down a port nearest the air handler slowly, with small breaks in the flow as to not over fill the drain pan. Doing this when you change
              your air filter is a good idea, but if you have a thicker filter (3-5"), do it every month. There are instances where the drain line can clog, just to 
              let you know. In those instances, having a wet/dry shop vac comes in handy! The process takes some time, but you can get the clog out and the 
              system running all on your own. To unclog it (in most cases), you will connect the shopvac to the drain line outside, turn it on and keep it on. 
              Next you will want to slowly pour hot water down the drain line inside at the air handler, much like during normal maintenance. The affect of 
              the hot water and turbulence from the shopvac will help break up the clog. After the clog has given way, i still recommend another gallon of hot 
              water while the shopvac is still on. This will help flush out any remaining debris and keep the drain line clear. Once the clog is cleared, you can 
              turn the shopvac off, got back to the air handler, and pour a final gallon of hot water down the drain line. This is to fill the trap with water,
              ensuring the system doesn't draw in air from outside. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Homeowner maintenance of the HVAC system can be a simple process, and can save you time and money in the long run, but maintaining system performance
              and cleanliness!

            <h3>HVAC Technician Maintenance</h3>
            
            <p>
              The HVAC technician is the one who comes out to your home and performs maintenance on the system, generally twice a year. The standard maintenance practices
              I follow cover the entire system, from airflow, to refrigerant performance and levels, to electrical components. Having all items professionally inspected twice a year not only
              helps maintain efficiency, but also helps catch any potential issues before they become a problem, and ensures everything is documented. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Generally, speaking with you about the system and how it has been performing is the first step in the process. I then turn the system on, in summer I lower the temperature by 10 degrees, 
              and in winter I raise the temperature by 10 degrees, allowing ample run time to check the system thoroughly. Then, I use my thermal camera to not only check the 
              temperature of the air coming out of the vents, but also the general path the air flows out of them. There is a lot to it, but the basics are to have the cold air blown across the ceiling, 
              that way as it falls it can mix and circulate throughout the space. Vents pointed straight down will cause pockets of warm air to form when in cooling. In heating vents should be pointed 
              a bit lower, but not straight down. This is to allow the warm air to rise and circulate as well. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Following the thermal camera inspection, I check the air handler! I personally use electronic guages to check air temperature, humidity, and static pressure. The first two are 
              pretty self explanatory, but static pressure is the amount of resistance the air is facing as it moves through the system. This is a very important number to know, as it can help
              determine factors like cleanliness of the coil and blower wheel, restrictions in the duct work, and even the type of filter being used. Manufacturers have a standard static pressure
              rating posted for each system, and if the static pressure is outside of that range, it can cause issues. This topic I can go on and on about, but I will save that for another time.
              Leading to what else I inspect in the air handler. With the system on and having checked the temp and flow of the air, i remove the air filter and caputre a picture of the return side of 
              the coil. That way i can inspect its cleanliness, and alert you to any build up on it. I also open the main panel so i can check the electrical components. Ensuring the connections 
              are tight, clean, and dry is very important! I also check the blower motor amp draw, and refer to the manufacturer's specs to make sure it is withing range. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The next portion of the maintenance takes me outside to the condensing unit (the big sometimes noise box outside). I hook up my shovac so that i can flush the drain line, and generally 
              let it run for a few minutes while i tend to the electrical components and refrigerant. I hook up my refrigerant pressure and temperature guages so that i can watch how the system
              is performing. Depending on the age of the system, it may use a different refrigerant, so i always check the manufacturer's specs first. While the guages are on, i open up the electrical compartment 
              and check amps, volts, and cleanliness. I also test the capacitor under load, but also with the system off and it disconnected from all wires. Doing both will let me see how efficient the capacitor is, 
              and if it is out of tolerance, i can inform you of the issue. Checking the contactor is important as that take the low voltage signal from the thermostat and connects the high voltage across it 
              to allow the compressor and fan to run. Then with the system off, i can check the ohms of the compressor and fan windings. Out of tolerance readings can indicate a vast amount of issues, affecting
              performance and efficiency, but also the life of the system. After a thorough inspection of the electrical and refrigerant components, and with the system still off, i can then remove the top of the condensing 
              unit. This allows me to further inspect the components within, remove debris, and rinse the coil. 
            </p>

            <p>
              After the condensing unit is inspected, rinsed, and put back together, i can go into the attic to check the duct work. Since the outdoor unit had been off for a little bit, I turn the system back 
              on and use my thermal camera to check for any leaks in the ducts, but also temperature differences in the insulation. Leaky duct work can reduce the efficiencey of the system 
              up to 35%, causing higher energy bills, less comfort inside your home, and premature failures of the systems components. Proper insulation levels in the attic are crucial as well, because it has 
              has a similar effect to leaky duct work. The insulation is there to keep the heat in during the winter, and the heat out during the summer. Throughout the maintenance, i take a lot of pictures.
              This way it is not only documented, but i can show you the indepth condition of the system at a level you may not have seen before. Doing so brings up good talking points and allows you 
              to ask more indepth questions about your system, and if it needs anything or not. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, a proper maintenance will take about an hour and a half to 2 hours. This being done twice a year helps bring peace of mind to you and your family, keeps the system operating 
              efficiently, and most importantly, keeps you comfortable in your home!

            <h3>Repairs</h3>

            <p>
              The most unfortunate aspects of HVAC systems is that they can break down, it's only a matter of when. When it happens, it can be stressful, and you may not know what to do. The first step is to find
              a local HVAC company that aligns with what you are looking for. Some companies are quick and cheap, some are quick and expensive, and the list goes on. Setting that appointment is key though for 
              for your comfort, and to ensure the system doesn't get worse. A technician will come out, ask some questions about what had happend before it stopped working, or what you have noticed that 
              induced the call. Usually, they can determine where the issue is taking place quickly, and focus on that area first. Then they can check the entirity of the system to ensure nothing else is wrong. Far 
              too often there is one issue, but something else caused it, and sometimes not even in the same portion of the system. After they have completed the diagnosis, they will write up estimates to fix 
              the issue. Keep in mind, the technician will usually have more options than just the one that may get the system running again. Upon acceptance of the option given, the technician can either
              get started with the repair if it is something he has on the truck, or order the part and come back to install it. Depending on time of year, and the part itself, the repairs can happen the same
              day. However, it cant go without mentioning that some parts may take days, even weeks to come in. All of this will be discussed with you, and the technician will do their best to get you up and running as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some repairs can be handled immediately from stock on the truck. Some repairs may be temporary until OEM parts arrive, that is something to be weary of as well. That is usually done with higher 
              end companies that have the ability and equipment on had to do so to get you running until parts come in. Examples of repairs I have done same day are: blower motors, capacitors, contactors, coil 
              cleanings, drain line cleanings, adjusting vents, and adding refrigerant. Even after the repair is done, the technician will run test the whole system for a few minutes to ensure it is 
              operating properly. This ensures the repair is done correctly, and to your satisfaction. Some parts that may take days to weeks to conduct are: compressors, evaporator coils, 
              ductwork, and even some circuit boards. They are more robust portions of the system, and take longer to manufacture, ship, and install. Regardless, testing afterwards is always crucial. Some things to 
              keep in mind about repairs, time, and cost, is that a lot of companies are moving to having "flat rates" for repairs. Meaning, the price you see, is the price you pay, no matter how long it takes. 
              This kind of pricing allows for peace of mind that you won't be nickle and dimed by a technician. However, some companies still charge by the hour, and that can be a bit more stressful.
            </p>

            <p>
              With repairs, there is a lot of things to talk about and consider. A good technician can not only tell you what is wrong, but what caused it, and ways to prevent it. Since the HVAC system is complex 
              and has many moving parts, some diagnosis may take more time. Time is of the essence, but finding the issues, and other possible issues, is the most important part of the repair process. 
              With repairs also comes the option to replace the system, but generally this only occurs with older systems, or when there is no warranty on the system and repair costs start to add up in the 
              thousands. The technician will also give you those options and talk about them with you. Buying most repairs, and even replaceing the system, can be done with financing. It is very common to 
              finance a new system, or even a repair, as the system is much more than the magic box on the wall. System replacements are an investment, as in most areas, they are used year round. They can be a simple system
              that meets the industry standards for energy efficiency, or high end systems that keep the temperature and humidity at constant levels in your home! For more information on that, feel free to contact me below!
            </p>

            <p>
              Having repairs done to your system can be necessary, and a bit stressful for you and your family. However, a good technician will be able to help you quickly and efficiently, and get you back to your comfort zone.
              After a repair is done, it is always a good idea to sign up for a maintenance plan with the company of your choosing. Ensuring future issues are caught before they become a problem.

            <h3>Preventative Measures</h3>

            <p>
              There are a multitude of products out there to be considered as preventative measures. The first product just cost you some of your time and effort, and that is the personal maintenance you do 
              on the system every month. Other simple measures are: soft start kits, surge protectors, and more adjustable thermostats. Soft start kits are a great way to help the compressor start up, without having a 
              huge inrush of current on the compressor windings. They also start the compressor up slower, easing electrical consumption and wear. Surge protectors, much like the one for your tv and other electronics inside, 
              protect the part of the system they are connected to from power surges. Even with a whole home surge protector, it is always advised to have them on the condensing unit and air handler. They typically come 
              with a 5-7 year warranty, but the specifics can vary by manufacturer. Adjustable thermostats are a great way to help control the temperature and humidity in your home, which increases the efficiency of 
              the system. Which is a great way to save some money on your engergy bill! Some systems have more uses for them than others, but a properly calibrated thermostat can help a lot. 
            </p>

            <p>
              There are a lot of advanced products that can help your system maintain its efficiency, but also impove the air quality in your home. UV lights are a great way to ensure a sterile environment in your air 
              handler. The air handler has a cold, wet coil, and as the air flows across it, so do all sorts of particles. The uv lights can kill and/or sterilize the particles, transforming your air handler from a 
              dark moist breeding ground for bacterial growth, into a bright sterile environment. Uv light systems I have installed have helped reduce allergies in some customers, even asthma and other respiratory issues. They 
              also promote fresher smelling air, even a few moments after being installed. Some people are weary of them, but it is something that can be found in every hospital, and is a great way to help keep the air clean.
              There are also uv systems that have an oxidizer, that elmiminates odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air. They DO produce ozone, but the levels disipate quickly as the ozone is used up 
              from breaking down odors, componds, and bacteria. The ozone levels are well below the EPA's recommended levels, and are safe for you and your family. I personally run a uv light and oxidizer in my 
              system at home, as I wanted to test it on myself before recommending it to others. They do work great, but much like anything else in the world, there are limitations. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Limitations for uv systems can be as simple as a dirty air filter, overloading their ability to sanitize the air coming in. Quality air filtration is key! The best combination i have found is a 4-5" thick 
              air filter with a MERV rating of 11-13, and a uv light + oxidizer, for the best air quality. Yet, there are other air filters out there that can improve air quality even more. HEPA filters are the best option 
              to capture the most dust and debris, but without proper duct work sizing, they can cause issues for the system. They do have models that work as a bypass, eliminating the need to adjust all your ducto 
              work, but you will still need a standard air filter in the unit, or in the filter back grills. The other air filters are electronic air filters. Not to be confused with electrostatic air filters. Electronic 
              air filters use low voltage electricity to a ballast to convert it to high voltage electricity. This high voltage electricity is then sent to the filter, and creates a magnetic field that captures the dust and debris in the air.
              This allows the filter to capture dust and debris all around the filter, not just the surface the air initially contacts. They are another fantastic option for your air quality at home!
            </p>

            <p>
              All of this boiled down is, keeping your system clean helps protect your system, maintains its efficiency, and keeps you comfortable in your home! For any further questions, feel free to reach out to me!
