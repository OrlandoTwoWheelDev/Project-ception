      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Orlando. I used to be a HVAC Service Technician.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for hvac, learning new video games, diving deeper into my new career as a Full stack developer.</p>
      <p>This project is me sprouting out after a successful coding bootcamp at FullStack Academy. For the project I wanted
         to touch all the basics, and learn new (to me) tech on the fly! I originally started out with JavaScript, but eventually
         decided on something a little more risky... TypeScript, while learning it on the fly. This also ushered in other tech stack 
         changes, such as NextJS. I'm storing my data in PostgreSQL, using Vite for quick development, along with Next.js as the 
         framework. </p>
