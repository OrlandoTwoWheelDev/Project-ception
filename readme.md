# Project-ception
This project represents the bridge between my past in HVAC and my new career in tech. It started with long conversations with ChatGPT, exploring how to connect the hands-on, diagnostic nature of HVAC with the logic and problem-solving of software development. After diving deep into Fullstack Academy, I began reflecting on how my past experiences in HVAC mirrored my journey in coding. My curiosity and drive to understand how things work have been key drivers in my growth as a developer.

Just a few months before starting my bootcamp in January 2025, I was a full-time HVAC technician. My computer skills were limited to gaming and pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del. Fast forward four months, and I’m coding with a passion that matches my previous work ethic. This project marks my transition from HVAC to tech—fueled by a desire to learn, build, and grow.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack used in this project reflects my “about me” section, where I describe how I bring my HVAC mindset into software development. I started this project in JavaScript (JS), but as it grew, I chose to convert most of it to TypeScript (TS). That decision came from a desire to write cleaner, more secure, and structured code—just like I used to do when servicing HVAC systems.

After watching videos and talking things through with ChatGPT, I realized TypeScript gave me an extra layer of confidence in my code. Instead of running into unexpected bugs at runtime, I could catch issues earlier. Although I'm still finalizing the full TS conversion, I already feel how much more solid my codebase has become.

## TypeScript Thoughts
At first, TypeScript felt intimidating—especially after reading posts online and watching hours of tutorials. But after digging into it, I realized it’s just JavaScript with added safeguards. It's not a monster; it’s a toolbox. One that helps catch bugs before they break things. While I haven't finished testing every component, the journey so far has been eye-opening and incredibly rewarding.

If I had to rate TypeScript, I’d give it a 9/10. It adds a bit of work upfront, but the peace of mind it gives during development? Totally worth it.

Note: This project was built under a self-imposed 7-day sprint to simulate a real-world development cycle. While there’s still fine-tuning to be done, the goal was to build out the core functionality and deliver a solid, presentable MVP.

## The Great Pause
After 7 intense days of work—starting in .cjs and transforming the code into a cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript project—I’ve hit a breaking point. Honestly, I never imagined I’d make it this far just 4 months into my tech journey. This project is far from perfect, but it stands as a reflection of how much I’ve learned, adapted, and grown.

I’ve wrestled with tsconfig.json, battled deployment issues with Render, and learned the intricacies (and dangers) of Express catch-all routes. Every bug, every confusing error message—it’s all been part of the ride. And what a ride it’s been.

For now, I’m stepping back—but not giving up. I plan to polish and build on this project further. But at this point, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. I’ll be adjusting my README to reflect that some functionality runs best locally, and that’s okay.

Thanks for checking it out. This is just the beginning.
