# Project-ception
This project represents the bridge between my past in HVAC and my new career in tech. Initially, I spent long hours discussing how to connect the two worlds with ChatGPT. After weeks of diving deep into Fullstack Academy, I reflected on my past experiences in HVAC and how they mirrored my journey in coding. My natural curiosity and drive to understand why things work the way they do have been key drivers in my growth as a developer.

Just a few months before starting my bootcamp in January 2025, I was a full-time HVAC technician—my computer skills limited to playing video games and using Ctrl+Alt+Del to open the task manager. Fast forward four months, and I’m diving into coding with a passion that mirrors my previous work ethic. This project marks my transition from HVAC to tech, fueled by the desire to learn and apply new skills.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack I used in this project aligns with my "about me" section, where I describe how I’ve incorporated my skills from HVAC into coding. A key part of that stack is JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS). While I originally built 80% of this project in JS, I eventually decided to explore TypeScript because it aligns with my philosophy of creating clean, secure, and well-structured code—much like my approach to HVAC.

The decision to switch to TypeScript came after watching videos and discussing with ChatGPT. I realized that TS offers extra layers of security, helping me catch bugs early in the development process instead of encountering frustrating issues during runtime. Although I’m still in the process of converting the project to TS, I’m excited about how much cleaner and more secure my code feels now.

## TypeScript Thoughts
When I first encountered TypeScript, I was intimidated by what seemed like a massive learning curve, especially after reading online forums and watching YouTube videos. However, as I dug deeper, I discovered that TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with added layers for security and reliability. It’s not a scary monster—it’s a tool that allows you to catch bugs early and build more secure, reliable applications. I’ve really enjoyed the process of transitioning, even though I haven’t reached the testing phase yet. I'll update this section once I’ve fully transitioned and tested everything.

Overall, I’d rate TypeScript 9/10—it’s a bit more work up front, but it’s totally worth it for the peace of mind it provides during development.
